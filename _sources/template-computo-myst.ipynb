    "# Point process discrimination according to repulsion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In numerous applications, cloud of points do seem to exhibit repulsion in the intuitive sense that there is no local cluster as in a Poisson process. Motivated by data coming from cellular networks, we devise a classification algorithm based on the form of the Voronoi cells. We show that, for data  representing the locations of antennas in a cellular networks, we can retrieve some repulsion between antennas, a feature that  was expected for engineering reasons.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the performance analysis of cellular systems, the locations of\n",
    "antennas (or base stations) play a major role (see\n",
    "[@BaccelliStochasticGeometryWireless2008]). It is usually admitted that\n",
    "they can be modeled by a Poisson process. But the data which can be\n",
    "gathered from the Web site of the French National Agency of Radio\n",
    "Frequencies, Cartoradio, see [@ANFR], tend to prove that this may not be\n",
    "the case. More precisely, if we look at the global picture of all\n",
    "antennas in Paris, we see features reminiscent of a Poisson process\n",
    "(local clusters for instance), see\n",
    "Figure [\\[fig:antennas\\]](#fig:antennas){reference-type=\"ref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:antennas\"}. However, if we look closer and finer, by\n",
    "specifying a region and a frequency band, we see that the antennas\n",
    "locations do seem to exhibit some repulsion (see\n",
    "Figure [\\[fig:antennas\\]](#fig:antennas){reference-type=\"ref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:antennas\"}, right picture).\n",

    "In previous papers, point processes with repulsion have been used to\n",
    "model such systems [@Deng2014; @Miyoshi2016; @gomez_case_2015] for no\n",
    "reason but a mere resemblance between the pictures like the right\n",
    "picture of Figure [\\[fig:antennas\\]](#fig:antennas){reference-type=\"ref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:antennas\"} and those obtained by simulating a point\n",
    "process with repulsion. The question is then to decide, given one sample\n",
    "of positions of base stations in a bounded domain, whether it is more\n",
    "likely to be modeled by a point process with repulsion or by a neutral\n",
    "point process, i.e. where the locations could be considered as coming\n",
    "from independent drawings of some identically distributed random\n",
    "variables. As we only have a single realization, we cannot use frequency\n",
    "methods. Since the observation window is finite, we cannot either resort\n",
    "to estimates based on stationarity or ergodicity and we must take care\n",
    "from the side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale behind our work comes from [@goldman_palm_2010]. It is\n",
    "shown there that the Voronoi cells of the Ginibre point process (a\n",
    "particular point process with repulsion, see below for the exact\n",
    "definition) are in some sense more regular (closer to a circle) than\n",
    "those of a Poisson process (see\n",
    "Theorem [1](#thm:goldman){reference-type=\"ref\"\n",
    "reference=\"thm:goldman\"}). By simulation, this feature seem to persist\n",
    "for other point processes with repulsion, like Gibbs processes. It is\n",
    "this aspect that we use to construct our classification algorithm. We\n",
    "will simulate several configurations (repulsive and non-repulsive) with\n",
    "the same given number of points $N$. For each configuration, we will\n",
    "compute the Voronoi diagrams and construct two vectors which will\n",
    "represent the input of our algorithm; an area vector containing the\n",
    "areas of the $10$ innermost Voronoi cells in order to avoid edge\n",
    "effects, plus $4$ other average areas from $20$ cells to have more\n",
    "information on the configuration. And a second perimeter vector which is\n",
    "constructed in the same way, containing the squared perimeters of the\n",
    "corresponding Voronoi cells. The choice of areas and square perimeters\n",
    "as aspects to our classification task is based on the isoperimetric\n",
    "inequality in $\\mathbf{R}^2$ that states, for the length $P$ of a closed\n",
    "curve and the area $A$ of the planar region that it encloses, that\n",
    "$$P^2 \\ge 4 \\pi A$$ and that equality holds if and only if the curve is\n",
    "a circle. After normalization, we test some classical ML models\n",
    "(logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost) to\n",
    "classify between repulsive and neutral point processes. The results are\n",
    "surprisingly good even though we trained our models only on Ginibre\n",
    "point processes to represent the whole family of point processes with\n",
    "repulsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is organized as follows. We first recall the theoretical\n",
    "notions that we will need in the rest of this paper. We will also\n",
    "briefly define the Papangelou intensity which is at the core of the\n",
    "definition of repulsion. In section 3 we show numerically, and based on\n",
    "two Machine Learning classification models, how the locations of\n",
    "antennas in Paris can be considered as repulsive configurations.\n",
