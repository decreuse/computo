    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In numerous applications, cloud of points do seem to exhibit {repulsion} in the intuitive sense that there is no local cluster as in a Poisson process. Motivated by data coming from cellular networks, we devise a classification algorithm based on the form of the Voronoi cells. We show that, for data  representing the locations of antennas in a cellular networks, we can retrieve some repulsion between antennas, a feature that  was expected for engineering reasons.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the performance analysis of cellular systems, the locations of antennas (or base stations) play a major role (see {cite}`BaccelliStochasticGeometryWireless2008`). It is usually admitted that they can be modeled by a Poisson process. But the data which can be gathered from the Web site of the French National Agency of Radio Frequencies, Cartoradio, see {cite}`ANFR`, tend to prove that this may not be the case. More precisely, if we look at the global picture of all antennas in Paris, we see features reminiscent of a Poisson process (local clusters for instance), see Figure~\\ref{fig:antennas}. However, if we look closer and finer, by specifying a region and a frequency band, we see that the antennas locations do seem to exhibit some repulsion (see Figure~\\ref{fig:antennas}, right picture). \n",
